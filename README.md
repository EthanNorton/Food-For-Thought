These are random (non-published) thoughts that I have put together. Probably all of them will be enjoyable yet an obsessive thought spiral I encounter.

4/16 update: I am going to start diving deeper into some of these topics.

I'm working on learning how to organize and categorize these files, so I'm open to comments here. I'm learning through Udemy at the moment.
