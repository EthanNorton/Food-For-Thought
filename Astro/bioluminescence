How to assign life to energy to store light wavs as distinct entities:

Does each individual's consciousness have a distincy wavelength?

1. Bits and proof of work can deduce where bits came from (objective).
2. For sustainability is it imperative that there are proportions weighed to groups of light waves in order to maintain an ecosystem?
3. Distinct biolumninescence from our consciousness could be the tool to unlocking: time travel, and many other things. 
4. This could also scientifically unlock cross animal communication -> tune the bioluminesencce to a soundwave device that can discover how different animals communicate.
  a. This would help unlock all languages into a same language, dependending on country language.
5. Dating apps could even edit their algorithms to go off of bioluminessence instead of traditional algorithms for compatability.

**Working on building querying skills.** I'm not very technical here, but there are probably tools and labs that exist
to test this at a macro and micro level.


Deep biosphere life:

1. What if we were able to apply deep learning techiques to the deep biosphere life? Would that speed up more discoveries?
2. Would blockchain or a deep learning AI be a better approach? Blockchain supposedly has quicker transactions,
would that also lead to quicker scientific discoveries due to scalability?
3. Could blockchain technologies be used to 

Blockchain applications:
