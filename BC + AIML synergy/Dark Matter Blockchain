The quantum mechanics and infrastructure:

This would be apart of Venus' job to:
1. Apply this to bridge the gaps for different apps
2. Clean up on the loose bits or dying apps, try to predict stop loss and if willing, liquidify bits.
3. Continuously check that the apps are performing the optimal algorithm given their situation, as well as environmental situation.
4. Can look at chemical compounds and compare molecular chain growth to blockchain growth. 
 a. Just as a chemical compund grows or is "volatile", a blockchain will grow in a similar way. Therefore, there can be new blockchain and algorithm approaches that model this.

They can work very closely with Fantom for optimization techniques.

Is there a way to connect different algorithms within a single blockchain in order to grow more efficiently? I.E. based on economic scenario, can a blockchain pivot its algorithm?
Yes, the volatility can be estimated with higher level of precision with a conjunction of:

For example, ideally ReLU function. However, the blockchain could transform into a conjugation during a stagflation to save computational power within the blockchain.
