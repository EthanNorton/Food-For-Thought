This would be apart of Venus' job to apply this to bridge the gaps for different apps, and to clean up on the loose bits.
1. Can look at chemical compounds and compare molecular chain growth to blockchain growth. 
 a. Just as a chemical compund grows or is "volatile", a blockchain will grow in a similar way. Therefore, there can be new blockchain and algorithm approaches that model this.

Is there a way to connect different algorithms within a single blockchain in order to grow more efficiently? I.E. based on economic scenario, can a blockchain pivot its algorithm?
For example, ideally ReLU function. However, the blockchain could transform into a conjugation during a stagflation to save computational power within the blockchain.
