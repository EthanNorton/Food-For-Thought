Goal of this: to find treasure in the trash and discover innovators.

1. Unlock potential by a collab with Mr. Beast and Microsoft for talent development.
  a. Mr. Beast and Microsoft can be funded and work closely through the Elongate coin/app. Mr. Beast should probably work on getting his own coin, to connect to BNB chain. I would invest.
2. Then, we can help them mine their own data and they can self develop (through BNB chain).
3. Amazon can follow this by cleaning up trash throughout the world (fun!), and cleaning up trash around these people's environments.
4. Binance Spacce-x can look at ways to mine asteroids and slowly bring back these materials to mine, and have a top up approach to growth, and support their users with ground growth, too.
  a. This can be done with tapping into NASA. Blue Origin, SpaceX and helping fund them through FTM. 
  b. The payoff would be a % of the returned materials that would be provided to users, which would encourage further growth of the BNB chain.
