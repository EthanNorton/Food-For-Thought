Goal of this: to find treasure in the trash and discover innovators.

1. Unlock potential by a collab with Mr. Beast and Microsoft for talent development.
2. Then, we can help them mine their own data and they can self develop (through BNB chain).
3. Amazon can follow this by cleaning up trash throughout the world (fun!), and cleaning up trash around these people's environments.
