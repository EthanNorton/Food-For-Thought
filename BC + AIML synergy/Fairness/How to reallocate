Have data scientitists deduce where the mined and leaked data came from, reallocate it once user creates Trust Wallet. Then, the individual can opt in to have their 
data mined (securely) for them to earn even more income passively! **There are over 19,000 coins where this data is held, but most is in ETH and BTC.**

Target the "critical threshold" first.
