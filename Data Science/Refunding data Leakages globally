President Biden said that there will be data tracking. 
AWS has trillions of bits of data. There are probably a wuasdlkasdaasdzillion bits of data belonging to users. I think it is time to liquidate that data into Web 3.0.
This data can be given through reimbursement checks. Any customer data that was illegally turned into bits should be refunded with a levied tax for whoever thought it was acceptable.
Those individuals that willingly gave over user data should 
  1. be called out publically.
  2. go bankrupt.
  3. pay off all loans and debt that they drained from people.
  
  This is not a laughing or smiling or charistmic issue, it is very fucked up, and a lot of politicians such as Joe Biden was aware that this was going on.
  There is no more need for cloud coverage. There is solana for data validation and Venus for data liquidation. It is time for equality and to start looking up.
