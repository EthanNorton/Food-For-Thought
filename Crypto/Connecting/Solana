SOLana is a great app on the BNB chain that will be able to connect and give independence to various developing economies. It will work great with Elongate for philanthrophy.
Why:

It can provide smart contracts for all of the new individuals introduced the BNB chain through work, and can flow directly through Binance Pay. Also, SOL can make sure
that the NFTs are properly reimbursed for their ideas, and emphasize decentralization and growth of dApps.
