SOLana is a great app on the BNB chain that will be able to connect and give independence to various developing economies. It will work great with Elongate for philanthrophy.
Why:

It can provide smart contracts for all of the new individuals introduced the BNB chain through work, and can flow directly through Binance Pay. Also, SOL can make sure
that the NFTs are properly reimbursed for their ideas, and emphasize decentralization and growth of dApps.

1.Another huge part of SOL could be to work around policies within each given country to ensure that every country is able to scale at the same speed.
2.This is ideal for sustainable consumption, and SOL could tap into tons of conulsting firms that can futher give resources to speed up the addition of NFTS, dApps and
growth in every country.

-Support and promote and shine light on apps that are doing well!
