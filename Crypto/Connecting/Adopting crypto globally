1. Have governments officials adopt and endorse cryptocurrency themselves.
2. Connect main crypto databases, so that they are interoperateable (Binance, Crypto.com, Coinbase, etc).
3. Have people government ID associated with a central crypto app (probably almost definitely Binance --> more efficient, ethical, quick, creative, secure...).
  a. This will allow easier cross border travel, and people cannot have duplicate Binance accounts. If not, then this should be corrected.
