Chainlink's mission:

-Be the empirical and nano-robust chain that links up all the chains to BNB.
-Connect with universities worldiwde to accept universal "truths" and statistics. This can be flexible, but at certain points in time chainlink should dictate what is true and false.
  -How? It is voted on through public and private institutions in the areas. This is collected and categorized through chainlink (with the aid of their apps -- which should probably be universities in the area).
    -Perhaps there should be weight based on university ethical history, with a time series component for recency.
