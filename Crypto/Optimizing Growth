Have the mix of the various BNB chains w Venus flowing through each branch:

-SOL (data validation through SQL and AI and ML engineers)
  -AI4Diversity (great consistent content).
  -Plug in MANGA and other consulting firms tokens (such as Sustainable Business Consulting, etc). 
    {https://sustainablebizconsulting.com/our-team/?utm_content=208137735&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkedin&hss_channel=lcp-3337072}
   -{https://t.ly/26btlfL} resilent and sustainable data foundation.
  -*will rise based on assistance, and could even surpass SOL in value.*
  
-NEAR (transaction fees/collateral)
  -Bitcoin
  -Ethereum
  -Dogecoin
  *will rise based on assistance, and could even surpass NEAR in value.*
  
-FTM (have astrophyists apply crypto throughput(?)), 
    -Elongate (Social Impact)
      -Supervises Amazon through environmental protection.
      -Connects Osmosis and elevates Osmosis to another level.
      -Jennifer Chu Materials Database (help her create own coin). {https://news.mit.edu/2022/topological-materials-database-0519}
      -Taps in STARL for better communication.
        -Github stores the open source code (free speech).
          -Effectively storing the open source code {https://bit.ly/3Ntn2LE}
  
-Hedera (plug in Manga collaborating together + apply LIFO to grow the bottom economic line {which will also have highest level of talent growth}).
  -Sustainable Business Consulting (triple bottom line).
  -Then, apps such as Metaverse and future growth can be a subcategory.
  -Apecoin here?
  -Elongate supervises here as well. Is StarL associated with elon or not?
  -*will rise based on assistance, and could even surpass Hedera in value.*
  
  -FairLawne Real Estate (tokenize).
    -{hellotomo.com} for scalability support.
    -Cardano Capital under.
  
 It is very likely that there will be more branches that grow throughout the chain and there are seperations in the long run. 
    -However, right now (May 19,2022), there seems to be growth too quickly and there should be an algorithm that can quickly categorize these various apps.
    -Coins such as Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc will likely be on every branch.
    
I imagine that the mix of these will solidify BNB as the chain that the rest want to tap into, and will unify the world so we can grow together, without excluding anybody -- at hopefully in point in time.
I also imagine a neural network infinite fibonacci sequence spiral tree that can display this and be a great way to organize in the future.
