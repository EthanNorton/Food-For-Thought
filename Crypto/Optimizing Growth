Have the mix of the various BNB chains: SOL (data validation through SQL and AI and ML engineers), NEAR (transaction fees/collateral) **plug in dogecoin and maybe others transactional currencies here?**, FTM (have astrophyists apply crypto throughput(?)), Hedera (plug in Manga collaborating together + apply LIFO to grow the bottom economic line {which will also have highest level of talent growth}).

I imagine that the mix of these will solidify BNB as the chain that the rest want to tap into, and will unify the world so we can grow together, without excluding anybody -- at hopefully in point in time.
