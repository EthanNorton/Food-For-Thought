Have the mix of the various BNB chains w Venus flowing through each branch:

-Elongate (Social Impact)
  -Supervises Amazon through environmental protection.

-SOL (data validation through SQL and AI and ML engineers)
  -AI4Diversity (great consistent content).
  -Plug in MANGA and other consulting firms tokens
  -*will rise based on assistance, and could even surpass SOL in value.*
  
-NEAR (transaction fees/collateral)
  -Bitcoin
  -Ethereum
  -Dogecoin
  *will rise based on assistance, and could even surpass NEAR in value.*
  
-FTM (have astrophyists apply crypto throughput(?)), 
  -StarL (Is this the official crypto for Starlink?)
    -If so, this would be a great one to connect with.
  -Stella
  -AI4Diversity here too.
  -Osmosis should plug into BNB blockchain and add in the podcast guests here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue0XMiftFFE&t=10s). Great way to grow for starters. I will add persnal docs and listen to podcasts to support you, too!
  -*will rise based on assistance, and could even surpass FTM in value.*
  
-Hedera (plug in Manga collaborating together + apply LIFO to grow the bottom economic line {which will also have highest level of talent growth}).
  -Then, apps such as Metaverse and future growth can be a subcategory.
  -Apecoin here?
  -*will rise based on assistance, and could even surpass Hedera in value.*
  
 It is very likely that there will be more branches that grow throughout the chain and there are seperations in the long run. 
    -However, right now (May 19,2022), there seems to be growth too quickly and there should be an algorithm that can quickly categorize these various apps.
    -Coins such as Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc will likely be on every branch.
    
I imagine that the mix of these will solidify BNB as the chain that the rest want to tap into, and will unify the world so we can grow together, without excluding anybody -- at hopefully in point in time.
I also imagine a neural network infinite fibonacci sequence spiral tree that can display this and be a great way to organize in the future.
