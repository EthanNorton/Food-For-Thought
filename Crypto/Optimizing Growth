 It is very likely that there will be more branches that grow throughout the chain and there are seperations in the long run. 
    -Coins such as Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc will likely be on every branch.
    
I imagine that the mix of these will solidify BNB as the chain that the rest want to tap into, and will unify the world so we can grow together, without excluding anybody -- at hopefully in point in time.
I also imagine a neural network infinite fibonacci sequence spiral tree that can display this and be a great way to organize in the future.


How I will invest my funds in the long run probably:
35% BNB (RN 80% staked)
20% Venus (RN 10%)
10% FTM
10% Elongate
5% Hedera
5% Near
5% SOL (RN 10% waiting to stake)
5% StarL (Lex Fridman Led Metaverse)
5% Random
