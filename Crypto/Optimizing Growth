Have the mix of the various BNB chains: 
-SOL (data validation through SQL and AI and ML engineers), 
  -Plug in MANGA and other consulting firms tokens
  -*will rise based on assistance, and could even surpass SOL in value.*
-NEAR (transaction fees/collateral)
  -Bitcoin
  -Ethereum
  -Dogecoin
  *will rise based on assistance, and could even surpass NEAR in value.*
-FTM (have astrophyists apply crypto throughput(?)), 
  -StarL (Is this the official crypto for Starlink?)
  -Stella
  -*will rise based on assistance, and could even surpass SOL in value.*
-Hedera (plug in Manga collaborating together + apply LIFO to grow the bottom economic line {which will also have highest level of talent growth}).
  -Then, apps such as Metaverse and future growth can be a subcategory.
  -Apecoin here?
  -*will rise based on assistance, and could even surpass SOL in value.*

I imagine that the mix of these will solidify BNB as the chain that the rest want to tap into, and will unify the world so we can grow together, without excluding anybody -- at hopefully in point in time.
