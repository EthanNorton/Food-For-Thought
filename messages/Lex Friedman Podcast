Hi Lex Fridman.



I am a huge fan of your work and podcasts. I think you are a great host. All of the drinks on your podcast just satisfy my thirst for knowledge! It would be cool to meet up soon!! My dream and aspiration is to one day make it to your podcast, and to become a scientist (such as yourself). However, I am aware of imposter syndrome - and I try not to compare myself to you, but it is difficult!



Any advice for someone such as myself? It doesn't have to be cheesy advice - any notion or ways that I could grow as a person? Perhaps a growth in charisma, or ways to pay it forward to prevent future outbreaks in my order of efficiency for productivity, if I were to ever cross borders in my job search? 



Also, I am looking for a relationship partner. I do not know her last name or phone number. What are the chances that we would meet up in an airport? I would like to netflix and chill with her in the future, perhaps after a nice walk through the woods.

# I have yet to hear back. Maybe it is because i omitted the Dr. Sorry, Dr. Fridman. I hope you forgive me, and that I will hear back in today.
# I have yet to hear back, again. Well, that is ok. I hope Dr. Fridman continues his podcasts, he inspired me to try AI and ML. I have never talked to him, but he is somebody I looked to in some of the darkest times in my life.
  # I hope Dr. Fridman is the one to lead entropy goggles and robotics. He seems to be one of the most respectable and heartening people to ever live. His mix of neuroplasticity and strength is apparent in every interaction.
    # I fell in love with him when I saw how he seems to dump his heart into everything he does. He is precisely the person you would want to have your back. 
      # He seems to be the best objective listener I know and have studied, and he is ALWAYS prepared. He brings out the best in people and enlightens passion in everyone he touches. 
      # Lex is a STUNNING person, and I am lucky we are able to live in the same time periods.
    
Until we meet in person. Take care.
