Hi Lex Fridman.



I am a huge fan of your work and podcasts. I think you are a great host. All of the drinks on your podcast just satisfy my thirst for knowledge! It would be cool to meet up soon!! My dream and aspiration is to one day make it to your podcast, and to become a scientist (such as yourself). However, I am aware of imposter syndrome - and I try not to compare myself to you, but it is difficult!



Any advice for someone such as myself? It doesn't have to be cheesy advice - any notion or ways that I could grow as a person? Perhaps a growth in charisma, or ways to pay it forward to prevent future outbreaks in my order of efficiency for productivity, if I were to ever cross borders in my job search? 



Also, I am looking for a relationship partner. I do not know her last name or phone number. What are the chances that we would meet up in an airport? I would like to netflix and chill with her in the future, perhaps after a nice walk through the woods.

# I have yet to hear back. Maybe it is because i omitted the Dr. Sorry, Dr. Fridman. I hope you forgive me, and that I will hear back today.


Enjoy your sunday! :) Goodbye.
